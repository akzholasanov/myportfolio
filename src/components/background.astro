      I'm a frontend engineer focused on building modern, high-performance, and
      user-friendly web applications. Currently, I work as part of a team where
      I contribute to creating thoughtful interfaces and collaborate with
      talented developers to deliver high-quality results.

      <br />
      My journey in tech began during my studies, when I became curious about how
      websites work. That curiosity quickly turned into a profession, and since then,
      I've been continuously learning and evolving—mastering new technologies and
      applying them to real-world projects.
      <br />

      I enjoy bridging the gap between engineering and design. My goal is to create
      applications that are not only technically sound and scalable under the hood
      but also polished and intuitive on the surface. I care deeply about clean,
      maintainable code, performance, and a great user experience.
      <br />
      <br />
      Outside of work, I like to stay active—snowboarding, cruising on my penny board,
      or working through my personal bucket list.
